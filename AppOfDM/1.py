1. Make a list from the first 1000 prime numbers and calculate their sums
2. Find all the primes in [ 10^6, 10^6+10^4 ] where ifn p is prime then p+2 is also prime
3. let n = 1000 ,find all numbers which are not divisible by 2,3,5
4. Make a list of length 20 where each members is a sum of numbers up to i (so the third member is 1+2+3...)
5. make a function which gives the first occurence of any numbers string within PI,or in general within any other irrational number
6. Make a list of 30 dice throw values
7. ** Make a list of 100 experiments contaioning 30 dice throws,count the number of experiments where its divisible by 5
8. ** Simulate coin flips and chart the occurence of the number of heads in a given experiment
9. ** Count the avarage amount of throws required to get a six with a dice and chart it
10. ** {∑j=0k(−1+i)jdj∣dj∈{0,1}} make a graph using the above formula use point()
