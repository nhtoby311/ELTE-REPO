Mark 2:
In a grid of size NxM there are nests. Each grid-point has a nest (therefore NxM nests are given).
In spring new-born birds (nestlings) will appear in each nest.
Write a generic function Count which counts how many nestlings are in a grid,
i.e.sums the new-born bird population in the grid.

The generic parameters are:
- an index type.
- the Grid represented as a matrix of size NxM with the above index and of natural elements.
The parameter of the Count function is a Grid, which provides new-born birds in each of the NxM nests (natural values).
The function should return the global (sum) number of new birds' population.
In a demo use a grid of 10x10, initialize it, and print the above global value.

-- Mark 3:
-- Write a generic function More_Than which decides if there are more then a given Max value new birds in a grid! 
-- If you reached the Max limit you can stop counting.
-- The generic parameters are like for the Count.
-- The More_Than function has a Grid parameter, and the Max natural value, and returns the answer to the above question.
-- In a demo use a grid of 10x10, initialize it, and print the answer.

-- Mark 4:
-- Write a generic function Count_Value which is similar to the Count one.
-- The generic parameters are:
-- - an element and an index type.
-- - the Grid represented as a matrix of size NxM with the above index and element types.
-- - a Predicate functor with an element type input and logical return value, and it decides if a nest has the given property.
-- The Count_Value function has a Grid parameter and decides how many nests are with the given Predicate property.
-- In a demo use a grid of 10x10, initialize it, and print how many nests have more then 3 new born birds.

-- Mark 5:
-- Write a Migrate generic procedure, which if a nest has more then Max birds, then it tries placing all the birds above 
-- the Max value in north, south, left right neighbor nests. 
-- Make local rearrangings, the birds that have no place in neighbor nests will fly away (no action needs to be taken).
-- The generic parameters are: the index type and the Grid type. The procedure has a Grid and a Max parameter.
-- In a demo migrate the birds of a grid of 10x10, and print the new grid.
